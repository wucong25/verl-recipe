# Tinker Server Client Examples

This directory contains client-side smoke workloads for the VeRL-backed Tinker
server. The examples use `tinker` and `tinker-cookbook` from a separate `uv`
environment and connect to an already-running server over HTTP.

## Setup

The client examples are their own `uv` project with their own environment. From
the repository root, change into this directory before installing or running
client code:

```bash
cd verl_tinker/client_examples
uv sync
```

This installs only client-side dependencies. It does not install core `verl` or
the `verl_tinker` server package.

## Start A Server

Install the server from the repository root, then change into the `verl_tinker`
recipe directory before launching it:

```bash
./install_verl.sh --recipe verl_tinker
cd verl_tinker

python -m verl_tinker.start \
  --config configs/quick_start/actor_rollout.yaml
```

For SFT-only tests that do not need sampling, use:

```bash
python -m verl_tinker.start \
  --config configs/quick_start/actor.yaml
```

For the dedicated-teacher OPD and top-K distillation examples on one eight-GPU
node, use:

```bash
python -m verl_tinker.start \
  --config configs/advance/qwen3_1b7_actor_qwen3_30b_a3b_teacher.yaml
```

For the Cookbook-faithful multi-teacher nightly workload, connect two
eight-GPU nodes to the same Ray cluster and use:

```bash
python -m verl_tinker.start \
  --config configs/advance/qwen3_8b_actor_qwen3_32b_qwen3_235b_teachers.yaml
```

The server strictly packs the Qwen3-235B teacher onto all eight GPUs of one
node. The other node is split between the TP4 Qwen3-32B teacher and the
four-GPU Qwen3-8B actor/rollout.

## Run A Workload

In another shell, change into the client examples directory so `uv run` uses the
client environment:

```bash
cd verl_tinker/client_examples
uv run run_single_test.py \
  --base-url http://127.0.0.1:8000/ \
  --test-name sft_tulu3
```

The runner waits for `/api/v1/healthz`, sets
`TINKER_API_KEY=tml-verl-tinker-local`, runs the selected workload, and asks the
server to shut down when the workload exits.

## Workloads

Set `--test-name` to one of:

- `sft_tulu3`
- `sft_norobot`
- `sft_norobot_no_rollout`
- `topk_distillation`
- `sdft_single_task`
- `rl_gsm8k`
- `sft_rl_gsm8k`
- `opd_deepmath`
- `opd_multi_teacher`

If `--test-name` is not set, the runner defaults to `sft_tulu3`.

Useful arguments:

- `--base-url`: server URL. Defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
- `--model-name`: model name sent to the Tinker Cookbook.
- `--tokenizer-name-or-path`: tokenizer path override. Defaults to
  `--model-name`.
- `--api-key`: Tinker API key compatibility value.
- `--test-name`: workload selector.
- `--lite`: cap training phases at 20 steps and reduce expensive batch,
  rollout, and evaluation sizes for nightly CI. Without it, workloads use
  their longer settings so learning trends and evaluation changes are easier
  to observe.

Run the dedicated-teacher top-K distillation demo with:

```bash
uv run run_single_test.py \
  --test-name topk_distillation \
  --model-name Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B \
  --lite
```

This is a thin wrapper around the Cookbook's `train_off_policy.Config` and
`OpenThoughts3Builder`. The Qwen3-30B-A3B teacher supplies 20 soft token
targets per position and the Qwen3-1.7B student trains on their weighted
cross-entropy. In W&B, `train/distillation/loss` should show a downward
smoothed trend. Lite mode uses 20 steps; the standard demo uses 200 steps to
make that trend easier to see.

Run the one-step OPD smoke workload with:

```bash
uv run run_single_test.py \
  --test-name opd_deepmath \
  --model-name Qwen/Qwen3-1.7B
```

Run the 100-step nightly multi-teacher workload with:

```bash
uv run run_single_test.py \
  --test-name opd_multi_teacher \
  --model-name Qwen/Qwen3-8B
```

This follows the Cookbook's DeepMath + Tulu3 teacher assignment, with 16
groups per teacher and two rollouts per prompt. `verl_tinker` trains full model
weights, so the Cookbook's LoRA setting is intentionally replaced by
`lora_rank=0`. A healthy run emits both `teacher_kl/dataset_0` (DeepMath) and
`teacher_kl/dataset_1` (Tulu3). Teacher identities are fixed in the client
recipes rather than exposed as runner arguments.

Some workloads download Hugging Face datasets. Configure the standard Hugging
Face cache environment variables if you need offline or pre-populated datasets.
